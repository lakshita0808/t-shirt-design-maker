The web project, titled "T-Shirt Maker," offers users a platform to customize and design their own t-shirts. The project addresses the need for personalized apparel by providing a user-friendly interface with four main tabs.

The Home tab serves as an introduction to the concept of t-shirt customization and showcases available templates for users to explore. It provides a brief overview of the customization process and sets the tone for user engagement.

The Design tab is the core feature of the website, offering a toolbox for users to personalize their t-shirts. It includes options to select from various templates provided by the website, allowing users to choose a design that suits their preferences. Additionally, users can customize the selected template by altering the t-shirt color, adding text in different fonts, sizes, and colors.

The Custom tab enhances user customization capabilities by enabling them to upload images directly from their computer. Furthermore, the tab introduces an innovative feature - image generation using artificial intelligence (AI). Users can input their requirements, and the AI generates images tailored to their specifications. These generated images can be further modified using the toolbox, offering users endless possibilities for creativity.

The Contact tab provides users with essential contact information, including email, phone number, and address. Additionally, it integrates Google Maps functionality to provide users with precise location details, enhancing the website's accessibility and user experience.

Overall, the "T-Shirt Maker" project aims to empower users to express their creativity and individuality through personalized t-shirt designs. By combining user-friendly design tools, a diverse range of templates, and innovative AI technology, the project offers a comprehensive solution for custom t-shirt creation.
